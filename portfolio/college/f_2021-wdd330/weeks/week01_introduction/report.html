		<h2>Answers</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>This is the first week, so there's no much to be done.</li>
			<li>I don't know really, I'm barely discovering the content of the class. I'm a little excited though with the idea of making a (or more than one) single web page application.</li>
			<li>Probably new content at the JS syntaxs. Those are the more difficults I feel. Also, incremented JS code complexity is something that many times bugs me a little.</li>
