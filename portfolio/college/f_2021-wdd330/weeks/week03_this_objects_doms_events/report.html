		<ol>
			<li>I need to work my ISP on fixing my internet connection. I haven't been able to work with my team because of the bad connectivity I'm having. It is because of some problems I have on my physical network. The hardware got too old and needs replacement.</li>
			<li>I want to fix the problem described above. It's an annoyance not been able to work with my team. Though if I can't find a solution by the next meeting time, I know I have some other connection options available. On the coding side, I'm planning to start the Novice to Ninja Quiz project. Also, I'd like to do the JavaScript30 challenges, but that seems to be a little out of reach by now. Also, I need to improve the way I'm doing this reports... I feel I'm skipping some guidlines about them.</li>
			<li>Connectivity, and time. Many times my weeks feels too short, and I'm not able to finish all the work easily on time. Coding is not a problem, really, not yet at least.</li>
