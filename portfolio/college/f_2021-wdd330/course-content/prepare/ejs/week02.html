          book. Remember though that if you are having trouble understanding a
          concept the way that this book presents it...go find another source!
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep the following Tips from week 1 in mind as well.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read for understanding not completion. This means that some weeks
              when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through
              the reading. Week one is a good example. It is intended to be
              mostly review and most of you should get through it fairly
              quickly. Other weeks you might have to read several times...and
              spend lots of time working through the code examples until you
              understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on
              your own for some topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dedicate sufficient time! For many weeks the reading will be most
              of the assigned work for the course. This means you probably ought
              to plan on 5-6 hours for the reading assignments. For some of you
              I would expect you will spend most of the time reading and
              understanding the concepts. For others you may spend most of the
              time working on the exercises. Play to your strengths and spend
              your time where it will benefit you and your learning style the
              most.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing
              these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with
              the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work
              through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take notes! One of the most important things that you can include
              in your notes are questions that arose in your mind as you were
              reading. Having this list will help you to know what topics need
              more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor
              asks: "Any questions from the reading?"
            </li>
            <li>
              If I didn't assign a chapter in the book it is not because those
              topics are not important...but often because I expect you to
              already understand those concepts from a previous course. You may
              want to read some of the chapters I don't assign if the topics
              look unfamiliar to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                ...again, don't be afraid to find your own sources...sometimes
                the way an author explains a concept will not compute with your
                brain...find another explanation! Here are some additional
                resources you have free access to as a starting point:
