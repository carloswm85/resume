        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          Final week. The students should have their challenges finished. They
          should also prepare a ~3 minute video reviewing how they evaluated
          themselves on the outcomes, and showing justfication from their
          portfolios for their self-ratings. Review their ratings, video, and if
          necessary portfolio. If you agree with the self-assessment then award
          that grade...if not adjust as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this grade will count for 70% of the final grade. The
          other 30% comes from the weekly readings and team activities.
