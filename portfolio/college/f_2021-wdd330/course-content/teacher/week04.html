        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is build a Tic Tac Toe board. The
          focus is on DOM manipulation and events. The trickiest part will
          probably be clearing the board when the button is pressed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week is all about architecting and organizing code. For your
          meeting with them give an example of organizing code using ESModules
          and objects of some sort. This could be a factory function and
          prototype, an object literal, or an ES6 class. With the modules make
          sure to show that they need <kbd>type="module"</kbd> in their script
          tag in the HTML for it to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might then do something like this
          <a href="../examples/todo/index.html" target="_blank"
            >simple To Do list</a
          >. My example uses the class syntax. I went this way for two reasons:
          one it tends to be more familiar with students coming from other
          languages, and two if they move on to do any work with Angular, React,
          Vue, etc this is most likely the syntax they will be working with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the students will continue with this project for their first
          challenge in weeks 5-6, so don't worry about getting through the
          entire demo. Focus on how they can use modules and objects/classes to
          organize their code and make it reusable. You could also say a few
          words introducing MVC or some other design philosophy to explain some
          of the decisions you might make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Begin the demo with a bit of brainstorming on what parts and pieces we
          would need for the To Do list. Then help them to organize those parts
          based on what would need to be public or private. Most of it will
          actually end up being private. Since we are making this into an ES
          Module, the public stuff will go into a class that will get exported.
          The private methods will be in the module but not exported. Then build
          out as much of it as you have time for. See the comments in the
          example code above (<kbd>todo.js</kbd>).
        </p>
        <p>
          It would also be good to remind the students that 70% of their grade
          is not determined until the end of the semester. This is a time to
          learn, explore, and break stuff :). Encourage them to keep working on
          the topics that do not make as much sense as they would like and it
          will come. That is the purpose of the challenge assignments. As
          students are thinking about the project they would like to work on for
          the second challenge, remind them that there is no right or wrong
          project. The goal is to become better programmers.
