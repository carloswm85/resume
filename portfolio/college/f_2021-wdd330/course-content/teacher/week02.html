        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The first team activity happens this week. There will be one during
          most of the weeks. You can either designate groups, or let students
          self-select them. The activities are intended to be done in peer
          programming style. For online you might suggest something like
          multiplayer in
          <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >repl.it</a
          >
          to code together, or screen sharing in Zoom or Hangouts can work as
          well. The teams need to schedule an hour at some point during the week
          for the team activity. This week they will build a simple adding
          machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again with the readings, encourage them also to look to other sources
          when things don't make sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the
          way it addresses some topics might be confusing to some students. Help
          them to remember that there are other options. Several are listed in
          this weeks reading in fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be
          all from the assigned readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <p>
          Since the reading introduced object literals, mention in your meeting
          that pretty much everything in JS is an object with properties and
          methods. Review the three ways to declare functions (declaration,
          expression, arrow) and mention that since functions are just objects
          they can be bound to variables, or passed as arguments in functions
          (callback) or made part of another object.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use something like <code>console.dir()</code> on an array to
          show them what an array object looks like as well to introduce the
          array methods. (<code
            >array.includes(element) .push .pop .shift .unshift .slice .split
            .reduce .filter array.map(callback)</code
          >). Keep in mind that the team activity for next week will also be on
          the array methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your demo should show examples of using <code>const</code> and
          <code>let</code>, and contain a review of the three methods for
          declaring functions in javascript (function expression, function
          declaration, and arrow function). You could build on the
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc2.html" target="_blank"
            >calculator code from the team activity</a
          >
          (partially converted using an object or
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc3.html" target="_blank"
            >fully converted to an object</a
          >), or build a
          <a href="random.html" target="_blank"
            >random sentence generator as an example</a
          >.
        </p>
