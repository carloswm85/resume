        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week should feel like mostly review. We
          will revisit the Hikes app one last time. Our goal is to add some new
          functionality...the ability to add comments. The students can start
          with
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"

          if they need. Then they should use MVC to design and build a
          commenting system for the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces Asynchronous programming and AJAX
          using <code>fetch</code> and promises.
        </p>
        <p>A list of things you might discuss is below</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make a list of foods in a json file.</li>
          <li>
            Make a <code>fetch</code> call to get the list of foods. Explain
            that we can grab some data from a database, some html from a file,
            an image, etc with fetch. This has traditionally been done with
            XMLHTTPRequest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain that this takes time and JS runs asynchronously...it doesn't
            wait for things to finish before executing the next statement
          </li>
          <li>Add some logs to show this. for loop, setTimeout.</li>
          <li>
            Callbacks are the traditional way to handle this...but could often
            lead to unreadable code..."callback hell"
          </li>
          <li>
            Now we have Promises which address some of the issues from
            callbacks. Show the promise returned from our fetch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promises must be processed with a then() call. Anything that should
            happen after the promise resolves should go in the then().
          </li>
          <li>
            Once processed the Promise gives us a stream. That must be converted
            into the data that was sent back. It can be processed as
            <code>text()</code>, <code>json()</code>, or as a
            <code>blob()</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fetching data from a server is not the only thing that can take
            time. Create a longProcess function with a timeout in it. It should
            return a number after a delay. Try adding that number to another
            one.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
function longProcess() {
   setTimeout(() => {
      return 42
    }, 200);
  });
  const total = 100 + longProcess();
  console.log('total', total); // NaN
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Show how to create your own Promise, and show how we can get things
            to add up successfully.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
function longProcess() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (1) {
        resolve(42);
      } else reject('failed');
    }, 200);
  });
}
longProcess()
  .then(result => {
    let total = 100 + result;
    console.log('total', total);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
            </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish example with food list...create a getJson function with some
            error checking and use it to grab the list of things and then render
            it to the HTML.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
function getJson(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => {
      if (response.ok) {
        console.log('in then', response);
        return response.json();
      } else {
        throw new Error('not ok');
        console.log('will not run');
      }
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
} </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Pulling from a remote server works just the same as from
            locally...show pokeapi.co and look at the data it sends back.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
const baseUrl = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/';
const myList = getJson(baseUrl + 'type/3');

myList.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
  buildList(data);
});

function buildList(data) {
  const myListElement = document.getElementById('list');
  myListElement.innerHTML = data.pokemon
    .map(item => `&lt;li&gt;${item.pokemon.name}&lt;/li&gt;`)
    .join('');
}
            </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Talk about CORS</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <p>This would be a good time to
          really talk about Single Page Applications (SPA) as this gives us the
          last piece we need to really build one. A possible example could be a

          for the Hikes app that the students worked with in their team
          activity.

        <p>
          Here is a zip of the starter files (without the comments piece in case
          you do you office hour before groups have finished this week's team
          activity) if you want to use the routing example. I would first give a
          basic example of using Fetch and promises, then move on to this.
