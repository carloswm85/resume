        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will review the tools introduced last week, and begin
          the process of making our application scalable by adding dynamically
          generated product detail pages, and some organization using ESModules.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team2: Dynamic product detail pages" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team2</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team2</code>
              </p>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                We currently have one HTML file for each product we offer. This
                works ok when there are only 4 products, but we have plans to
                expand our inventory. We cannot continue with this model. The
                product pages all follow a similar template. There should be one
                HTML file that loads the details about the requested product
                through Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally as our code becomes more complex we will be well
                served by organizing it using ESModules.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our goal will be to eventually have a one to one relationship
                  with views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that
                  needs to be shared between modules can be placed in a utility
                  modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will begin this week by creating a module
                  (<kbd>productDetails.js</kbd>) to contain the code we will
                  need to dynamically produce our product detail pages.
                </li>

                <li>
                  it's very likely that other parts of our application will need
                  to make requests for product data. So let's make a
                  <kbd>productData.js</kbd> module to share that functionality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  there will likely be other functionality that needs to be
                  shared between parts of the application, you should notice
                  that there is already a
                  <kbd>utils.js</kbd> module to hold those that is currently
                  un-used.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>product-details.html</h3>
              <p>
                Instead of having an HTML file per product like we do currently,
                for scalability we would like one html file for all products
                that has some javascript in it to load the details. We need to
                create this HTML file. Open one of your current product pages in
                the editor, and file->Save As-> <kbd>product-details.html</kbd>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Refactor</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create two new files in the js directory:
                  <kbd>productData.js</kbd> and <kbd>productDetails.js</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any of the code from <kbd>product.js</kbd> that deals with
                  getting or filtering products will need to be moved into
                  <kbd>productData.js</kbd>. There are two functions that will
                  be easy to move (<code>getProductsData()</code>, and
                  <code>convertToJson(res)</code>, but if you look on line 29
                  you will see we filter our product list to find a specific
                  product. This line should be moved as well...we will need to
                  add a new function to our module for this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In order to make our module portable and easy to use, let's
                  create a class that we will put any public facing code from
                  our module in. Call it <code>ProductData</code>, and make it
                  the default export.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the <code>getProductsData()</code>, and
                  <code>convertToJson(res)</code> functions as methods in our
                  object.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add one more method called <code>findProductById</code> that
                  will take a product id and return the product with that id.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Import our module into <kbd>product.js</kbd> so that we can
                  use it. Make the other changes in the existing code to make it
                  work.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                After you have worked on your module check out the example below
              </p>
              <section class="hint">
                <input type="checkbox" />
                <h3>ProductData.js example</h3>
                <i></i>
                <div>
                  <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">function convertToJson(res) {
  if (res.ok) {
    return res.json();
  } else {
    throw new Error('Bad Response');
  }
}

export default class ProductData  {
  constructor(category) {
    this.category = category;
    this.path = `../json/${this.category}.json`;
  }
  getData() {
    return fetch(this.path)
      .then(convertToJson).then((data) => data);
  }
  async findProductById(id) {
    const products = await this.getData()
    return products.find((item) => item.Id === id);
  }
}
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>
                    Notice the <code>getData()</code> method compared to the
                    <code>findProductById()</code> method. One uses just
                    promises and <code>.then()</code>, the other uses
                    <a
                      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"
                      target="_blank"
                      >async/await</a
                    >. Many find the async/await syntax to be easier to read
                    (and write) than the typical <code>.then()</code> based
                    promise handling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the syntax on line 15 <code>(data) => data</code> is
                    confusing you may want to spend more time reading about
                    arrow functions in Javascript. You could re-write that short
                    callback function like this using a more traditional
                    anonymous function declaration:
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(data) { return data; }</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    The callback on line 19 is similar...<code
                      >(item) => item.Id === id</code
                    >. Another way to write that could be:
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(item) { return item.Id === id; }</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    It is very common to see short functions that just return
                    some value or expression written using the arrow function
                    syntax.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </section>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>URL Parameters</h3>
              <p>
                We need to have some way of passing in the product that we want
                to show the details for. A common way to do this is through a
                <a
                  href="https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >URL Parameter</a
                >. If we create a link like this:
                <code>&lt;a href="product-details.html?product=880RR" &gt;</code
                >. We have embedded the id of one of our products into the link.
                When the page loads it will have access to that information. If
                you read through that article it suggests the following lines of
                code to retrieve it:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const product = urlParams.get('product')
            </code></pre>
              <p>
                Use those lines to create a new function in the
                <kbd>utils.js</kbd> file called
                <code>getParams(param)</code> that we can use to get a parameter
                from the URL when we need to. Import your new function into
                <kdb>product.js</kdb>. Open <kbd>index.html</kbd> and change the
                link to the first product page from
                <code>href="product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"</code> to
                <code
                  >href="product_pages/product-details.html?product=880RR"</code
                >.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Where did the <code>880RR</code> come from? If you look in the
                <kbd>json/tents.json</kbd> file you will see that each record in
                there has an id. <code>880RR</code> is the id for the first
                tent!
              </p>
              <p>
                Then test your getParams function in <kbd>product.js</kbd> to
                see if you can get the product id successfully when someone
                navigates to the product-details page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>productDetails.js</h3>
              <p>
                We should model the <kbd>productDetails.js</kbd> file similarly
                to the <kbd>productData.js</kbd> file by placing the public
                methods in a class. The following methods are recommended:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <code>constructor()</code>: this is recommended for classes
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>init()</code>: there are a few things that need to
                  happen before our class can be used. Some will happen in the
                  constructor and will happen automatically. Others it is nice
                  to have more control over and so we will place them into an
                  init method.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>addToCart()</code>: This is the function that is
                  currently in <kbd>product.js</kbd>. We need to move it here
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>renderProductDetails()</code>: method to generate the
                  html to display our product.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                It will be nice for our product to keep track of important
                information about itself. I would recommend something like this
                for your constructor method:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">constructor(productId, dataSource){
  this.productId = productId;
  this.product = {};
  this.dataSource = dataSource;
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                With that information the product will know which id it has, it
                will have a source to get the information it needs when the time
                comes, and will have a place to store the details we need to
                show once we retrieve them.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use our class we need to pull everything from the last few
                steps together in the <kbd>product.js</kbd> file. Once we get
                everything refactored that file should look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import ProductData from './productData.js';
import ProductDetails from './productDetails.js';
import { getParam } from './utils.js';

const productId = getParam('product');
const dataSource = new ProductData('tents');

const product = new ProductDetails(productId, dataSource);
product.init();</code></pre>
              <p>
                Notice we import in the code we need from our modules. Then we
                get the id of our product using our helper function
                <code>getParams</code>. We create an instance of our
                <code>ProductData</code> data class with the url it should use
                to look for products. Then we use both of those to create an
                instance of our <code>ProductDetails</code> class so that it has
                everything it needs to work. Finally we call our
                <code>init()</code> method using our class instance to finish
                setting everything up.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team2/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes (don't
          forget to lint and format your code before committing!), then submit a
          pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a team,
          close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone should
          move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
