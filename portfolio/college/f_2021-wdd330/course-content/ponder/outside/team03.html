        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will continue the process of making our site more
          dynamic.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team3: Dynamic product list" task...then move it to 'Doing'.
                Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team3</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team3</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Read the Data</h3>
              <p>
                Our first task is to read the product data out of the
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file (our current data source). Lucky for
                us we did that same thing last week...and we created a module to
                expose that functionality. Import the
                <code>ProductData</code> module into <kbd>main.js</kbd>
                and create an instance of it.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>ProductListing class</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new file <kbd>productList.js</kbd> that we will use for
                the code to generate a list of product cards in HTML from an
                array. Add a class called <kbd>ProductList</kbd>, and think
                about what methods we will need to complete this task. Export
                your class as default, and import it into <kbd>main.js</kbd>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Begin creating your ProductListing module by writing the code
                for the constructor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually we will want to have more than one category of
                products, and list each out independently. In your constructor
                you should let the class know which category of products we
                want.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to make our class as flexible and reusable as possible
                let's also pass in the HTML element we want the product list to
                render to, and we should send in our dataSource.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then create an instance of your <code>ProductList</code> class
                in <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Review the code from the week 2 team
                activity if you need help remembering how to do this.
              </p>

              <h3>Working with templates</h3>
              <p>
                As we think about building our product list, each product card
                will have very similar markup. Templates are a way for us to
                re-use markup in an efficient way. Last week we just generated
                the dynamic html in Javascript but that does have a couple of
                issues.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  It breaks the separation of concerns. It would be good if we
                  left the HTML where it belongs...in the .html file instead of
                  buried in the javascript. This leads to more maintainable
                  code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The html and css for a site is often managed by a different
                  group than the logic in the Javascript. If the HTML is in the
                  javascript then everytime a styling change needs to be made
                  the Javascript will have to be modified instead of just
                  changing the HTML
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance. Generating lots of HTML through Javascript can
                  lead to performance issues.
                </li>

              </p>
              <p>
                HTML <code>template</code>s are perfect for what we need to do.
                Let's create a <code>template</code> element in the
                <kbd>index.html</kbd> file. Give it an id of
                <kbd>product-card-template</kbd>. You can place the element in
                the <code>head</code>. The contents should be one of the product
                cards. You can then remove all of the information that is
                specific to the product. It should look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;!-- HTML template to build a product card --&gt;
&lt;template id="product-card-template"&gt;
  &lt;li class="product-card"&gt;
    &lt;a href="product_pages/product-details.html?product="&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=""
      alt="Image of "
    /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="card__brand"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="card__name"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="product-card__price"&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                Add a method to your productList module to grab this template
                called <code>renderList</code>, then clone it once for each
                product in our list, and add it to the DOM. The method should
                take the product list as an argument.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Adding in the data</h3>
              <p>
                You should have some product cards showing, but they are all the
                same and are missing critical information. The next step is to
                add another method to the module called
                <code>prepareTemplate</code>. This method should take a template
                clone, and a product as arguments. It should then insert the
                information from the product into the template.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                If you have trouble with this step it is useful to remember than
                while we usually call methods like
                <code>querySelector</code> from <code>document</code>, all DOM
                nodes actually have access to that method. So we can do
                something like this:
                <code>templateClone.querySelector('.card__name')</code>. It will
                only look inside the template instead of looking at the whole
                document!
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Make it re-usable</h3>
              <p>
                The code for your <code>renderList</code> method probably looks
                something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">renderList(list) {
  const template = document.getElementById('product-card-template');
  list.forEach(product => {
    const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
    const hydratedTemplate = this.prepareTemplate(clone, product);
    this.listElement.appendChild(hydratedTemplate);
  })
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                If we look over that code...it is easy to imagine that we will
                want to do something similar later. We will probably need to
                generate more content with templates so let's make this function
                re-usable. Look for all the parts of the code that are specific
                to this use case: making a list of products
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  ln 2: the id of the template we will use is hard coded:
                  <kbd>product-card-template</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  ln 5: we call a method <kbd>prepareTemplate</kbd> that is very
                  specific to the current use case. That function would need to
                  be completely different if we were working with another
                  template.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ln 6: the element we will place our list in is hard coded:
                  <kbd>this.listElement</kbd>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The list of products is also specific, but we are already
                passing that in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dealing with items 1, and 3 is easy...we can pass those in. But
                what about #2, the function? Remember that functions can be
                passed into other functions in Javascript. (Search 'js
                callbacks' or 'js higher order functions' for more depth). Make
                a new function in
                <kbd>utils.js</kbd> called
                <code>renderListWithTemplate</code> and export it.
              </p>
              <p>
                It should take 4 arguments: templateId, parentElement, list,
                callback. Then move the code from your
                <code>renderList</code> function over to utils.js and refactor
                it to work with the new parameters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then import in your function to the
                <kbd>productList</kbd> module, and refactor
                <code>renderList</code> to use our new utility function.
              </p>

              <p>
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> has more tents than we currently need.
                Write a method in <kbd>productList.js</kbd> that will filter our
                list of products to just the 4 we need. Use that method to show
                only those 4 tents.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team3/src"
            target="_blank"

            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
