        <h1>Managing the modern Front-end workflow</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Development workflow has become quite complicated for Web development.
          Lets take a medium sized project for example. It could have dozens of
          javascript files, several css files, 3rd party libraries, and who
          knows how many icons, fonts, images, etc are involved. It might be
          using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or it could be transpiling the
          Javascript to make sure that new features will work in older browsers.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            A potential list of tasks that could need to happen everytime
            something changes is this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lint CSS and Javascript to find any coding issues.</li>
            <li>
              Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last
              changes
            </li>
            <li>compile all SCSS/LESS to CSS</li>
            <li>concatinate all CSS into one file for faster loading,</li>
            <li>Minify the CSS to reduce file size.</li>
            <li>
              Transpile Javascript with Babel for wider support for older
              browsers
            </li>
            <li>Concatinate all JS files into one file for faster loading</li>
            <li>Minify and Uglify Javascript to reduce size</li>
            <li>Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS</li>
            <li>
              Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to
              separate them from the development stuff
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whew! That's a big list...and they have to happen A LOT!</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It's no wonder that developers have produced tools to help manage all
          of this. This activity will introduce a simple implementation of some
          of these tools. The tools fall into three catagories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Package managers: These keep track of all of the external
            dependencies for our app. Both development tools and libraries we
            might be using. It knows not only which packages to download...but
            tracks versions as well. We are using <code>npm</code> for our
            package manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bundlers: bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating,
            minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using
            <code>Parcel</code> as our bundler. Another common bundler is
            Webpack
          </li>
          <li>
            Task managers: these keep track of what needs to be done and when.
            There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each
            phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just
            using <code>npm</code> again for task manager. Other common managers
            are Grunt or Gulp
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

            It will really help if you are familiar with the command line for
            your Operating system. Here is a quick overview to the

            if you need a primer.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must have
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
              >NodeJS</a
            >
            installed on your computer. Most of these tools require it. Goto

          <!-- <li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a>: This is a package manager for Node. You can install it
                    by running <code>npm install yarn -g</code> in your command line once you have installed NodeJS</li> -->
        </ul>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a new directory on your computer to hold your portfolio.
              Name it something like <kbd>wdd330-port</kbd>. These instructions
              will assume that you are using the VS Code editor. Things will
              work much easier if you are. Unless you have an editor that you
              know extremely well I would recommend that you use VS Code for
              this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open your new directory in your editor. Most editors work much
              better if you are working in a project. When you opened the
              directory in VS Code instead of a single file you told it to treat
              the directory as a project...and to treat all the files in the
              directory as related.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing we need to do is initialize our project. You can
              do this by typing the following in the command line for you
              computer
              <strong>while in the root of your project directory</strong>:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm init</code></pre>
            <div class="callout">
              One nice feature of VS Code is that it has a built in terminal to
              access the command line of your operating system. If you type
              <kbd>ctrl `</kbd> (That is hold the control key and the
              back-tick...the key to the left of the 1 key on common English
              keyboards.) That should open up the terminal window already set to
              the project directory.
            </div>
            <p>
              After answering a bunch of questions (you can accept the defaults
              for all of them) you should notice that a new file has been
              created...<kbd>package.json</kbd>. This file contains the
              information about your project that the tools we will be using
              need to function properly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Three types of tools were mentioned above. Step one had us
              initialize our package manager: npm. Now we need to setup the
              bundler we will be using: Parcel.
            </p>
            <p>
              To add the parcel tool into our project we will use the package
              manager. Type the following into the terminal:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev</code></pre>
            <p>
              This will create a new directory in our project
              <kbd>node_modules</kbd>. All of the packages we install with npm
              will be placed there.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to get Parcel to work we will need to provide it with an
              entry point into our project. Let's create that now. Make a new
              directory in your project called <kbd>src</kbd>, this is where we
              will place all of the code we write. Create a file called
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> inside that directory. Add some simple HTML
              as a start for your portfolio. (Another cool feature of VS Code is
              it includes a handly tool called
              <a href="https://emmet.io" target="_blank">Emmet</a>. It provides
              shortcuts for generating HTML code. In your empty
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> file type <code>!</code> then press the tab
              key. You should get a nice simple boilerplate for a new HTML
              document.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Add two more directories in <kdb>src</kdb>: <kbd>css</kbd>, and
              <kbd>js</kbd>. Inside of the <kbd>css</kbd> directory create a
              file called <kbd>style.css</kbd>. Place a simple css rule in there
              like <code>body { background-color: salmon; }</code> In the
              <kbd>js</kbd> directory create a file called
              <kbd>main.js</kbd> and type a simple
              <code>console.log('It worked!')</code> in it. At this point your
              directory structure for the project should look like this:
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/workflow-dir-structure.png"
                  alt="directory structure for portfolio"
                />
                <figcaption>Directory Structure</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              Finally let's let parcel know where to find the CSS and JS for our
              project. Add the following lines to the head of your index file:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="src/style.css" &gt;
&lt;script src="src/main.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We are ready to test our setup. This will be easier if we use some
              sort of task manager. We will use NPM for this as well. Open your
              <kbd>package.json</kbd> file back up. Find the section "scripts".
              There should be one line in there right now, a test command. Add a
              few lines to that section so it looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel src/index.html -d build/",
    "build": "parcel build src/index.html",              
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the folder with the boilerplate code in your editor. You will
            notice a few things.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <kbd>node_modules</kbd> : This is where all of the 3rd party
                tools we will need got installed to when you ran 'npm install'
                above.
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>src</kbd>: This is where I have placed all of the code.
                This is where you will work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>package.json</kbd>: This file contains the information
                about the dependencies for the project. When you ran the install
                command this is how it knew what to go get. We can also define a
                few scripts in here.
              </li>
              <li>Various other configuration files.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file in your editor. Look first at
            the <kbd>scripts</kbd> portion. You should see the following
            possible commands:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>prestart</code>: This gets run automatically when you run
                <code>start</code> or you can run it by itself as well. It does
                a bit of cleanup for us.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>start</code>: This command starts up our bundler Parcel.
                This starts a webserver on port 1234, clears out the 'build'
                directory, builds the new files based on what is in 'src'
                (transpiles with babel, compiles our Sass if we are using it,
                and concatenates all of our CSS and JS into separate files.),
                watches our files for changes, re-compiles everything on a
                change and refreshes the browser. It places the code in a
                <kbd>build</kbd> directory. Quite a lot for one simple command!
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>prebuild</code>: just like prestart this runs
                automatically when we run the <code>build</code> process.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>build</code>: This command gets our code ready for
                distribution. It runs a similar process to the
                <code>start</code> above, but also minifies the CSS and JS. It
                creates a <kbd>dist</kbd> directory. If you were publishing your
                app to a server that is the code you would move.
              </li>
              <li><code>watch</code> is very similar to <code>start</code></li>
              <li>
                <code>lint</code> runs a linter on your Javascript and will make
                recommendations and sometimes even changes to your code based on
                the rules it is configured with.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can run any of those scripts by navigating to the project
            directory and typing <kbd>npm run <em>command</em></kbd
            >. So to start parcel running and launch it's built in web server
            you would type <kbd>npm run start</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Look next at the <kbd>devDependencies</kbd> section. This lists out
            all of the tools we are using to facilitate our development. These
            tools will not be a part of the distribution code. This is a good
            thing, I don't know if you noticed...but the
            <kbd>node_modules</kbd> directory is over 100MB!
          </li>
          <li>
            To start up your tools go ahead and run
            <kbd>npm run start</kbd> in the command line. You should see the
            <kbd>build</kbd> directory get created and populated with files. And
            if you point your web browser to
            <code>http://localhost:1234</code> you will see a simple page. Make
            a change to any of the files in the project and the browser will
            auto-refresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you are done working you can hit <code>ctrl-c</code> in your
            command line to end that process.
          </li>
        </ol>
