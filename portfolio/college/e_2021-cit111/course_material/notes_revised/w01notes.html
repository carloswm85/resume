</ul>
</div>
<div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will usually go over preparation materials and the preparation check before the first class of the week, but since this first week they will do that before the second class of this week.</li>
<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W01 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="duringTheWeek">
<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>First of the week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the syllabus and course to the students.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Prepare students for the routine of the course:
<ul>
<li>readings with glossary terms, videos, and checks being done before the first class of the week,</li>
<li>quizzes on the second day of the week, and</li>
<li>homework due Saturdays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<h3>(W01 - Data to Decisions):</h3>
<li>Using the 7 page pdf file at <a href="http://cit111byui.github.io/roadsigns.pdf">cit111byui.github.io/roadsigns.pdf</a>, split the shapes and individual letters that don't go together into groups among the students and have them make sense of the data that is given to them. They must figure out that it is road signs that they are putting together and that they only have parts of some of the signs and other groups have the rest. Give them a while to see if they can make sense of it. Eventually, (or possible with subtle hints) someone will go to another group and start putting the pieces together. Have a discussion about data, information, knowledge, and decisions with the road signs activity.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Here are the completed signs:</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="../text/images/signs.png" alt="completed road signs" width="300px"></li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>If it's a short first week you may want to introduce the data gathering activity(W01 - Data Gathering - see below) and give them the sheet the first day of class so they can start gathering data. They should collect 3 days worth of data for Saturday's homework.</li>
<li>This week they will do their reading, videos and check before the second class of the week (instead of the first) (W01 - Check) Have the checks be due before class time.</li>
<li>They will also have their first quiz that day. The quiz will cover the syllabus, reading, videos, and, glossary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Mid-week</h3>
<ul>
<h3>(W01 - Quiz)</h3>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group are great 'teach one another' opportunities. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
<h3>(W01 - Tools in Your Career):</h3>
<li>Demonstrate different types of data and tools used in different industries and careers. There are students in the course who have knowledge of these tools and can demonstrate if you wish. Or you can just talk about each one. Follow up each demonstration with how it ties into databases. For example most of these tools use database data as the data that is being analyzed. This is to give relevance of the course to the students from so many different majors.
<ul>
<li>Geospatial
<ul>
<li>(relational databases and Excel) arcGIS (uses SQL behind a GUI interface)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.arcgis.com">www.arcgis.com</a> and Living Atlas are good examples of data&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accounting
<ul>
<li>(database tables and Excel) .csv and .txt files. They might use R, and PowerBI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economics
<ul>
<li>.csv files, tableau, Power BI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business Analytics
<ul>
<li>tableau</li>
<li>Power BI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Science

<li>R&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>CIT, CS or Software Engineering</li>
<ul>
<li>Show code in .NET, Python or PHP that has a query in it and how the application uses a database</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>End of the Week</h3>
<ul>
<h3>(W01 - Data Gathering):</h3>
<li>Have class gather data and record that data in an informal way.&nbsp; (Use these sheets: )<a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/files/data_gathering_activities.pdf"> https://cit111byui.github.io/files/data_gathering_activities.pdf</a></li>
<li>The homework due Saturday will be a spreadsheet with their gathered data (W01 - Data in a Spreadsheet). Some of the data gathering sheets will take 3 days of data gathering. The purpose of this assignment is to let the students see that data is all around us and can be gathered in a variety of ways. Data can be used as a tool to improve our lives. Students will also contemplate how data might be organized as they place it in their spreadsheet. The students will continue with this data next week. Next week there will be a Statement of Work that will explain what we will be doing with the data. They will also learn best practices of entering data in a spreadsheet next week.</li>
</ul>

Give feedback on any data they might be missing, the format of their spreadsheets is up to the students.</li>
