		<h2>During the Week</h2>
			<h3>First of the week:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of
						the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h4>(W10 - Summary Query Practice)</h4>
					<li>Demonstrate, explain and have them follow along with coding summary queries together.</li>
					<li>Here is a video of what I'd go over with them in class.</li><br>

					<br>
					<li><a href="../sql_code/w10_aggregate_practice.sql">SQL CODE FOR PRACTICE</a></li><br>
					<li>Remind students of the quiz on the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Mid-week</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt.
						The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another'
						activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h4>(W10 - Summary Query Practice (cont.)):</h4>
					<li>Just like the JOINS week, summary queries may take awhile to explain and help them understand.
						There may be some time this week for an extra activity, but I usually am just finishing up what we didn't get to in the practice from the class before.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>End of the Week</h3>
					<li>The homework due Saturday will be
						<ul>
							<li>creating a list of summary queries that produce the proper result sets.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

		<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be instructor or TA
				graded. It will be checking their summary queries and ensuring they produce the proper result sets.
			</li>
			<li>Here is the key:</li><br>

		<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first
				class of next week to be prepared for the next week.</li>
