    <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the
        week.</li>
      <li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W07 Course Group discussion <a

    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
            and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W07 - Query Art DB)</h4>
          <li>Because not all student inserted the data into the database properly, have them import the v_art database from
            the dump file so they all have the same database to query from.</li>
          <li>They will also use a new bike shop database this week. Have the students import all the databases they will use in this course as well. They are all contained in the course_databse.sql file. Reverse
            engineer the new bike database so the students can see the ERD and how it is designed with Database -
            Reverse Engineer.</li>
          <li>With the introduction of the SELECT statement coding order (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT) it's
            good to go over the order of execution order (FROM, WHERE, SELECT, ORDER BY LIMIT). This helps explain why
            you can use an alias in ORDER BY but not WHERE.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate, explain, and have them follow along with examples of querying the v_art and bike databases.
            Here are some examples:</li><br>
            <li>Here is a video of what I'd go over with them in class.</li><br>

          <br>
          <li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
            discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The
            two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>

          <h4>(W07 - Bike Shop Queries):</h4>

          <li>Case Study: This activity will be to retrieve the right data from the database for the bike shop owner (these are
            requests from the owner). Have the student complete these on their own or in groups. Here are some examples:

            <ul>
              <li>A few CRUD commands from last week related to the art_gallery database and creating queries to
                retreive the correct result set from the bike databases. Have the students look at <a
                  href="http://art.ceiwebdev.com/admin/main.php">art.ceiwebdev.com/admin/main.php</a> this is the
                back-end of the system where only admins would create, update or delete data in the system.
                <em>DON'T</em> give login information to the students. They would be able to change data if you do and
                we want to use this only for demonstrating purposes. <a
                  href="../VirtualArtGalleryProjectExplained.pdf">Art Application Explanation</a> This application is
                referenced in this week's Saturday assignment, showing some of the editing and deleting that can be done
                on the back-end of a system.</li>
