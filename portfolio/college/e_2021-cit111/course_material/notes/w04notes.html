    <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the

    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the beginning of the week and
          be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
      </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W04 - Relational Databases)</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w04_relational_databases.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Take the ERD you showed last week with their gathered data and now show them the tables with data. Explain
            again the tables and relationships involved. Explain that this is what makes a relational database
            relational. Talk about primary and foreign keys that were used. Show the design view of a table and also go
            over Not Null, Default values and Auto-increment and what they mean. Look at the data in each table and
            understand how primary keys won't repeat, but foreign keys might with a many relationship.</li>
        </ul>
          <ul>
                <h4>(W04 - Ward Design)</h4>
                <li>The following is a video that shows steps to design ward data into an ERD. Let the students lead the
                  design by asking them questions and let them ask you questions, the video is just for ideas. It's more
                  fun if they have discussion about it and are not just watching you do it.</li><br>

                <br>
                <li>This is a great place to cover referential integrity by explaining that you can't delete a ward when there are members that are in that ward and you can't add a member to a ward that doesn't exist.</li>
                <li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
            <h3>Mid-week</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
                  discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity.
                  The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <h4>(W04 - Database Design Practice):</h4>
                <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w04_database_design_practice.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
                <li>Show them a website that uses a database to populate the content on the web pages. Show them how
                  they might attempt to reverse engineer the database structure. Show the entities and attributes of the
                  entities. They will be doing this in their homework this week. For example you could show them:
                  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/index/hymns" target="_blank">https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/index/hymns</a> and talk about the entities and attributes that
                  might be needed.</li>
                  <li>Let them come up with ideas for entities, attributes, and relationships as practice for their homework.</li>
                <li>Here's a very simplistic ERD that might be created from that site:</li>
                <li><img src="../text/images/hymnserd.png" alt="hymns ERD" width='500px'></li>
                <li>For SQL practice/overview with the hymns example there are DML (Insert, Select) and DDL (Create, Drop) statements available in Digging Deeper this week.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>End of the Week</h3>
              <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
                <li>The homework due Saturday (W04 - Database Design) will be
                  <ul>
                    <li>creating an ERD of any database-driven website that they choose.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="gradingFeedback">
    <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be creating an ERD and
        submiting an image of that ERD. Be very lenient on their design, but give good feedback on how their entities
        and attributes and relationships are set up.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="lookingAhead">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first class
        next week.</li>
