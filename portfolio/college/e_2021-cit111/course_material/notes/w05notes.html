    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
            and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W05 - Student ERD Examples):</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w05_student_erd_example.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Pick some of the student examples from last week's assignment submissions and go over them with the class.
          </li>
          <li>Or you could also pick a few students, ahead of time, to present their ERD to the class.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mid-week</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
              discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity.
              The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h4>(W05 - Movies Design):</h4>
            <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w05_movies_design.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
            <a href="../files/movies_flatfile.pdf" target="_blank">Movies Data PDF</a>
            <li>Let the groups design the movie ERD on their own. Give them some introduction like the following video.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Once the groups are done giving it a try go over some topics like the following video.</li>

      <h3>End of the Week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The homework due Saturday (W05- Design the Art DB) will be an image of the art ERD that they will create.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be checking their art ERD.
        Below is the one I came up with. Notice that the dob and dod years are integers. This is because the range of
        the years accepted in the Year datatype range from 1901 to 2155. Many of the artist were born and died before
        1901. See rubrics for grading.</li>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

        the week to be prepared for the next week.</li>
