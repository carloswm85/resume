    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
            and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W06 - CRUD with Movies)</h4>
          <li>Use the movie database they designed last week to practice with the C.U.D part of CRUD commands.</li><br>
          <li>Here is a video of what I'd go over with them in class.</li><br>

          <li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of the week.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
            discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The
            two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>(W06 - Creating, Editing, and Deleting Data):</h4>
      <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w06_creating_editing_and_deleting_data.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Show them how to create a dump file with Server - Data Export - Self-contained file. This is a good way to make a backup or copy of your database.</li><br>
          <li>This is a good week to show them the Art application that uses the SQL queries that they will be creating
            for the art database. This is a document explaining the application and giving login names and passwords for
            the backend of the system where an admin user can perform CRUD operations. <a
              href="../VirtualArtGalleryProjectExplained.pdf">Art Application Explanation</a> This application is
            referenced in next week's Saturday assignment, showing some of the editing and deleting that can be done.
            <em>DON'T</em> give login information to the students. They would be able to change data if you do and we
            want to use this only for demonstrating purposes. </li>

          <h3>End of the Week</h3>
          <li>The homework due Saturday will be
            <ul>
              <li>creating a SQL file with the forward engineering code and then beneath that all the insert commands to populate the art database.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

  <div class="gradingFeedback">
    <ul>
      <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework (W06 - Insert Data into Art Database) 
        will be instructor or TA graded.
        Look at their forward engineering code and SQL insert commands file. (I found from past experience that even though they can enter data into
        the result set area in Workbench, it's usually best to have them create SQL insert statements. This is because
        if they mess up their database it's much easier to just drop that database and reverse engineer again and start
        over and if they have these inserts saved, they can edit and re-run them much easier than having to re-enter all
        the data into the database again.)</li>
      <li>Here is an example of what their inserts might look like.</li>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

      <li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first class of
        next week to be prepared for the next week.</li>
