<h2>CIT 111 Course Syllabus</h2>

<p>&ldquo;We have thousands of times more available information than Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln. Yet which of us would think ourselves a thousand times more educated or more serviceable to our fellowmen than they? The sublime quality of what these two men gave to us&mdash;including the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address&mdash;was not attributable to their great resources of information, for their libraries were comparatively small by our standards. Theirs was the wise and inspired use of a limited amount of information. Available information wisely used is far more valuable than multiplied information allowed to lie fallow.&rdquo; Dallin H. Oaks</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>This course teaches the basic elements of database management systems. It introduces students to the concepts of logical and physical relationships in a data model and the concept of inner join. Students will use a computer aided software engineering (CASE) tool to design, create, and query a database.</p>

<p><strong>This course does not fulfill a requirement for students majoring in Computer Information Technology.</strong> It is a requirement for students majoring in Information Systems and for several minors, clusters, and emphasis.</p>

<h3>Course Topics</h3>

<ul>

    <li>Database management systems</li>

    <li>Relational databases</li>

    <li>Tables, rows, columns</li>

    <li>Normalization</li>

    <li>Constraints</li>

    <li>Queries</li>

    <li>SQL</li>

</ul>

<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>

<p>Each student will develop fundamental knowledge and skills in using, designing, and building relational databases by doing the following:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Explain how data and databases are used in business systems.</li>

    <li>Demonstrate design and creation of relational databases.</li>

    <li>Use a DBMS (Database Management System) and CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool.</li>

<h3>Expectations and Requirements</h3>
<p>This course requires you to complete videos and readings located on the Canvas course before the first class of each week. You are also required to install a database management system (DBMS) on your computer and use that DBMS to design and implement small databases. You must have a laptop computer to use in class. You should also have a notebook for taking notes during lecture.</p>
<p>Open <a href="http://www.byui.edu/computer-information-technology/software/hardware-for-cit-courses">http://www.byui.edu/computer-information-technology/software/hardware-for-cit-courses</a> in your browser to see the department's hardware and software requirements. For the best hands-on learning experience, each student should have access to a reliable laptop computer that they bring to each class session, with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>sufficient user or administrator privileges to install new software on that computer,</li>
    <li>an i5 or better processor capable of hyper-threading,</li>
    <li>sufficient RAM to comfortably operate virtual machines on the laptop (8GB or more recommended, 4GB minimum (if you have extreme patience and pain tolerance)</li>
    <li>sufficient battery power to use the computer throughout each class session for in-class activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students unable to meet this technology requirement should contact me during the first week of the semester.</p>
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p>No textbook is required for this course, all readings and videos are found on Canvas.</p>
<h3>Course Standards</h3>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Attending each class period is expected. <strong>Missing class seven times will result in a maximum grade of C+ for the semester. Missing class ten times will result in an F for the semester.</strong> Whether you are in class or not, <strong>you</strong> are responsible for all lectures, in-class exercises, tests, programs, and handouts. You may obtain class notes, assignments, instructions, etc. from another student.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>You can view the class schedule in the calendar section of I-Learn. The instructor may make changes, deletions, corrections, or additions to the schedule during the semester.</p>

<h3>Checks</h3>

<p>At the beginning of each week, there will be required videos and readings that go with that week's discussions. The videos and readings have a check that goes along with them that can be completed as you complete the viewings and readings. The checks are due before the first class of each week.</p>

<h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>All quizzes are closed book. Each quiz has a time limit and will be taken <strong>in class on the scheduled date</strong>. Quizzes can only be taken late if you contact me before the quiz date with a valid reason (e.g., a field trip for another class) or you contact me as soon as possible in the case of an emergency. The quiz will be given twice in class that same day. The first time it is taken will be by yourself and the second time you can take it as a group with a discussion about the questions.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>All graded homework submissions <strong>must be your own work</strong> but you may collaborate with students, tutors, teaching assistants, and the instructor to help you understand the concepts. Don&rsquo;t just give your work to another student. These homework assignments are due on Saturday evenings 11:59pm.</p>

<h3>Late Work</h3>

<p>There is a 20% penalty applied to any late work received within 7 days of the due date. There is a 40% penalty applied to any late work received within 14 days of the due date. Work turned in later than 14 days after the due date will receive no credit.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>Exam questions will be drawn from the videos, readings, lectures, in-class coding and group work, and assignments. The Exams will be 60-minute exams given in the classroom. There are two Final Exams and both will be comprehensive and taken in the last two weeks of the course. <strong>You may not take the exams early.</strong></p>
