					<small class="mb-1">This two-part series shows you through all the basics. In this course, part one of the series, instructor Matt Milner shows you classes, structs, variables, and much more. Matt begins by placing C# in context with .NET, MSIL, and the Base Class Library. He walks you through understanding and working with classes, structs, and records. Then Matt shows you several useful techniques to organize your C# code. He discusses variables in-depth, then dives into how to define, enable, and test enums, as well as how to use nullable types and work with null objects. Matt goes over if, else, and switch statements and covers switch expressions, the is expression, and an introduction to patterns. Plus, he explains several types of patterns and describes how to use guard conditions to further refine your switch case matches.</small>

					<p class="mb-2">Technology Focus: Databases, SQL, DB Browser for SQLite</p>
					<p class="mb-2">Instructor: Scott Simpson</p>
					<small class="mb-1">Once you get beyond basic programming, you'll need a database. Databases provide a consistent, organized structure for storing and retrieving large amounts of data. They allow programmers to build more complex applications that can take orders, process payments, make recommendations, authenticate users, and more. This course provides the foundation you need to get started in database programming. Explore the terminology: normal forms, ACID and CRUD, referential integrity, transactions, records, and tables. Learn what role keys and unique values play in a relational model. Discover how to design the best system to contain your data, starting with the tables and relationships at the core of your database. Find out how to write queries to extract the data you need, and how to juggle the different demands of storage, access, performance, and security. Instructor Scott Simpson provides practical examples and clear explanations that will help you design databases that can withstand the needs of your applications, your data, and your users.</small>
