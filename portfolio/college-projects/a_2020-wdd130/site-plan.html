      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content you should put on the site it is critical to determine the purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that purpose. Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for the website. -->
      <p>White Water Rafting Company's site, is a simple 2 paged site for a local rafting family business. WWRC is a local brand with state scope. The main goal of the site is to share information about the family business and sell their service to local costumers. The usage of images, videos and customer testimonies is central to the site. As important as the last paragraph is the relationship of the site with the nature and outside family life. WWRC is a family business, run for decades by a local family for other families. Prestige, trust,  and good service are central values for the business.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target costumers for WWRC are families or group of friends (despite the edgy name of the company). Spending quality time is important for WWRC costumers. They are busy people and they need to enjoy the scarse free time they have. They are young families and friends who have enough youth, time and money to face the challenges of good rafting sport. For the most part, they are highly active people.
        They want quality time, as describe above, and they are looking for good service, good nature, good lodging (if necessary) and good food for the time to eat. They want adventure, that's what they need, and they need it to create treasureable memories in their minds. This audienve will usually access the site via social media, using either their desktop computers, laptos, tablets or mobile devices.

        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: 'Patua One', cursive;  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Patua One font fits pretty much well the typography used in the site logo.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Arimo <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Arimo font makes good contrast with the strong appareance of the Patua One font.  <!-- change this -->

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
