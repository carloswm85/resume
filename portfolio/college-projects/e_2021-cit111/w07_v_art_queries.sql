SELECT fname AS 'First', mname AS Middle, lname AS Last
FROM artist;

SELECT fname AS 'First', mname AS Middle, lname AS Last
FROM artist
ORDER BY Middle; -- Here's using the alias for ordering

SELECT fname AS 'First', mname AS Middle, lname AS Last
FROM artist
WHERE mname IS NOT NULL -- It does not work with aliases â†’ Why? Because of the order in which the code is actually executed (read note below);
ORDER BY Middle;

/*
This is the order of how you must write the code.
	SELECT
	FROM
	WHERE
	ORDER BY
	LIMIT
But the order in which the system actually executes the clauses is different. This is referred to as the Order of Execution.
	FROM
	WHERE
	SELECT 
	ORDER BY
	LIMIT
The latter is the reason why ALIASES can't be used with WHERE.
Aliases are created in SELECT.
