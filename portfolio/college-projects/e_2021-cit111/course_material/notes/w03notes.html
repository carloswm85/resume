      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
          and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>

          <h4>(W03 - Big Data)</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w03_big_data.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>

              PBS</a></li>
          <li>Discuss how data is helping to build the kingdom (gather Israel) with Geneology data. President Nelson has
            said that "the gathering is &ldquo;<em>the greatest</em>&nbsp;challenge,&nbsp;<em>the
              greatest</em>&nbsp;cause, and&nbsp;<em>the greatest</em> work on earth today". Databases play a huge role
            in this process.&nbsp;</li>

          </li>
          <li>Have groups discuss ways 'Big Data' companies might use data to personalize your experience with them.
            Adding personalization takes a lot of storage.&nbsp; What data might they need to store about each user?
            Give each group a company to discuss and then share: Amazon, Facebook, Expedia, Google, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W03 - ERD and Datatypes Intro):</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w03_erd_and_datatypes_intro.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Show the ERD that goes with the data they collected the first week of class.</li>
          <img src="../text/images/gatherdata-erd.png" alt="ERD for data gathering tables in relational database design"
            width="500px">
          <li>Show the students how the data they had in their spreadsheet might look as tables in the database by
            looking at the ERD you will use. Look at the datatypes you chose and why. Look at the datatype drop down for
            other types of data and discuss what you might store in some of the other datatypes. Point out how the way
            the table columns are used in the ERD will reduce data redundancy. They will be learning about the
            relationships next week. You can leave the relationship crows feet off if you would like or let them know it
            will be explained next week. This week we just want to show the column attribute arrangements and datatypes
            used in the ERD.</li>
        </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week, there will be a quiz the second day of each week.
        </li><br>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The quiz this week will be on datatypes and database models.</li>
        <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
          discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two
          scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
      </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W03 - SQL Overview Practice)</h4>
          <li>Use the following datawinter database to demonstrate an overview of SQL.</li>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/datagathered_dump.sql">datagathered_dump.sql</a>

          <li>When showing the sql code remember, the students do not need to be able to create any of this code.
            The purpose is just to show them the code and explain what each does and the purpose of each. Let them know
            we will learn how to code later in our course. You can let the students download the dump file (W03 - Import datagathered.sql) 
            and practice
            with it as you show them the statements. I typed the first few with them and went over common syntax errors
            like forgetting the semi-colon between statements. Also showing how to run just one statement at a time in
            Workbench. The queries that use aggregates, group bys, and joins I just showed them and didn't have them
            type them in. The point is to show how detailed of questions we can ask the query, not to teach the SQL
            statements at this point.</li>
          <li>This is also a good chance to talk about datatypes and how they allow different data to be entered. For
            example, the worry_category is VARCHAR and the dist_category followed the categorization of the data gather
            sheets with ENUM. The query showing the top worries has a result set that is not as succinct since the data
            entry person wasn't limited on what they could enter. There are misspellings and categories that didn't fit
            with the worry_category as represented in the data gathering sheet.
          </li>
          <li>Here is a video of what I'd go over with them in class.</li><br>

      <ul>
        <li>The homework due Saturday (W03 - SQL Overview) will be
          <ul>
            <li>Completing the SQL Overview Assignment after reading 'Simply SQL' by Rudy Limeback.</li>
