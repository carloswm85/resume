      <h3>First of the week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Review for the exams.</li>

        <li>Here are some examples you could use to review for the coding final.</li><br>

    <h3>Mid-week</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be two days with two finals. You can have them take them both the last week of regular class or
          have them just take the coding final the last week of regular class and leave more time for reviews if you
          choose and then they would take the multiple choice final during testing week.</li>

      <h4>(W13 - Questions Review)</h4>
      <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w13_questions_review.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
      <li>There is a Kahoot.com game with 50 questions to review for the final if you'd like to use it. The students
      really like this. You will need a kahoot user name if you want to use it. Set up an account at kahoot.com and
      email me andersonju@byui.edu your kahoot name if you'd like to use it and I'll share it with you. DO NOT share the
      kahoot with students just let them play it. Some of the questions are very similar to the final. In fact, I don't
      even let them take pictures of the screen while playing. Some questions are just freebies (any answer will give
      them points) so I can review topics. I do let them take pictures of those screen if they want. Students begin the
      game at kahoot.it.</li>

    <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The Coding Final is partially auto-graded so they get some of the points right
        away. Remind them that the rest of the points come when the instructor or TA grades each submitted query. The
        multiple choice final is auto-graded. </li>
      <li>Here is the coding final queries key:</li><br>
