<div class="objectives">
<h2>Week 04 Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learn about a relational database modeling system (CASE tool)</li>
<li>Understand what a relational database is and how the keys are used in relationships</li>
<li>Understand what an entity is and how they are related to other entities</li>
<li>Understand what attributes might belong to an entity and the datatypes of those attributes</li>
<li>Understand the different between DDL and DML statements</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the week.</li>
<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W04 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="duringTheWeek">
<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<h3>First of the week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the beginning of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>(W04 - Relational Databases)</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Take the ERD you showed last week with their gathered data and now show them the tables with data. Explain again the tables and relationships involved. Explain that this is what makes a relational database relational. Talk about primary and foreign keys that were used. Show the design view of a table and also go over Not Null, Default values and Auto-increment and what they mean. Look at the data in each table and understand how primary keys won't repeat, but foreign keys might with a many relationship.</li><br>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (W04 - Ward Design)</p>
  <ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
  <li>The following is a video that shows steps to design ward data into an ERD. Let the students lead the design by asking them questions and let them ask you questions, the video is just for ideas. It's more fun if they have discussion about it and are not just watching you do it.</li><br>
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWhgHu13f94" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<li>Show them a website that uses a database to populate the content on the web pages. Show them how they might attempt to reverse engineer the database structure. Show the entities and attributes of the entities. They will be doing this in their homework this week. For example you could show them: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/index/hymns and talk about the entities and attributes that might be needed.</li>
  <li>Here's a very simplistic ERD that might be created from that site:</li>
  <li><img src="../text/images/hymnserd.png" alt="hymns ERD" width='500px'></li>
<li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>(W04 - DML and DDL Statements Overview):</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>You could show students SQL queries that might go with the website you looked at the class before. (DML and DDL) Show them the tables with data vs. the tables in the ERD diagram. Go over the following statements:</li>
<pre>
-- This code is examples of what we will be learning the rest of the 
-- semester. Students don't need to understand all the code,
-- just have some exposure to what a few DDL and DML statement look like

-- DDL statement to manage objects like databases, tables, columns
CREATE DATABASE hymns;

USE hymns;

-- DDL creating a new table in the hymns database

  hymn_num INT NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
