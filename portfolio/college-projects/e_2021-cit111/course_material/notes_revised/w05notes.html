<h2>During the Week</h2>

<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
  <li>Remind students of the quiz the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;">(W05 - Movies Design):</p>
  <ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>

<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="gradingFeedback">
<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be checking their art ERD. Below is the one I came up with. Notice that the dob and dod years are integers. This is because the range of the years accepted in the Year datatype range from 1901 to 2155. Many of the artist were born and died before 1901. See rubrics for grading.</li>
