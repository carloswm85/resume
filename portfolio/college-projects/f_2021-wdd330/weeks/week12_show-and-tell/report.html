		<h2>Answers</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Worked in my project 2. I've been doind some modularization, which is a topic that got me worried because of my lack of understanding on it. Also, I move forward with the UI, and I was able to fetch data from json files and I also implemented websockets. I also implemented a third party library for an online trading chart.</li>
			<li>I'll try to finish up the goals proposed by the teacher, as milestones for my project, if possible next week. After that I'm going to try new goals, and make some improvements to what I already have.</li>
			<li>Probably my lack of understanding in topics related with software design and patterns. I'd fell more comfortable with what I'm doing right now if I were more knowledgable in those topics.</li>
