		<h2>Answers</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Went through the readings (half way through them, I'd say). I was able to meet with my team-mates (gladly), and go through this week assigment. I was not able to start with the Ninja Project, but I will (during this semester or later).</li>
			<li>Do we have a team project to do later in the semester? Anyways, I'm planning on organizing better my week, so I can finish reading and assignments in time.</li>
			<li>So far, my only blockers are reading time-scheduling and my internet connection (which I haven't been able to fix yet).</li>
