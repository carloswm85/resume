        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week borrows from the Javascript30 course
          again. We will get more experience with events and transitions by
          building a simple key driven drumset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remind students that next week we will begin working on the second set
          of challenges. We will spend the rest of the semester working on
          these. They should submit their idea(s) this week in the form of a
          simple project proposal.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          We are getting close to the second set of challenges, so for your
          meeting time plan to spend some time addressing challenge ideas with
          students. I would also take the opportunity to talk about modern
          frontend workflow. You can use this activity from the weekly readings
          to drive the discussion:
          <a href="../resources/workflow.html" target="_blank"
            >modern workflow</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example provides a simple project boilerplate that uses a package
          manager (NPM), a bundler (Parcel), and a task manager (NPM). There is
          a link in Ilearn to that resource as well. (Bottom of the Modules list
          in 'Stuff')
