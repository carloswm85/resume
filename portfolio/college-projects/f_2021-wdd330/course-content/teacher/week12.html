        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. The only assignment this week is the team activity
          (&lt;1hr) so they should plan on spending the rest of their time
          working on their projects. (~7-8 hrs).
        </p>
        <p>
          The team activity should be shorter than normal to allow more time for
          the students to work on their challenges. They will simply be sharing
          something from their project. This could be a success, or challenge.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week you should use your meeting for questions on projects.
