        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. There is no team activity so they should plan on spending
          all of their time working on their projects. Remind them also that
          their team can still be a resource to them. They can bounce questions
          off of each other and get help.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week you should use your meeting for questions on projects.
