        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will aid you in getting the project and environment
          setup for your team. It will introduce a NodeJs based workflow and
          development/build tools.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should have already completed the

                  activity. Go and do that now if you have not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should visit the Team's copy of the project Trello
                  board and add each team member to the "Setup project for all
                  team members" task. Then move it to "Doing"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make sure that you are familiar with how to use the command
                  prompt for your operating system. Here are some quickstarts

                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver for this week should then log into Github, and
                  visit this
                  <a href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside"
                    >repository</a
                  >
                  for the project. Click on the "Use this template" button to
                  create a copy of the base project code in a new repository
                  then give the new repo a name.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should then goto Settings->Manage Access and add
                  the rest of the team members as collaborators. (Each team
                  member needs to have their own Github account for this step.
                  Create one if you do not have one.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then clone the repository to
                  their computer.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Finish the project setup:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then open a terminal window and
                  switch to the project directory (If you are using VS Code and
                  open the folder as the current project and type
                  <kbd>ctrl ~</kbd> the terminal window will automatically be
                  set to the right directory.) then type <kbd>npm install</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice that a new directory was created:
                  <kbd>node_modules</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  This project comes with several tools built in to help the
                  team to write error free consistent code. The driver should
                  open up the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. There are two
                  sections initially you should review.
                  <code>devDependencies</code>, and <code>scripts</code>.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>devDependencies</code> contains all of the tools we
                      will be using in our development for this project. When
                      you ran <kbd>npm install</kbd> earlier, it referred to
                      this list to know what to install.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>scripts</code> are shortcuts to commands we can run
                      to manage the project. It contains the following:
                      <pre><code class="lang-json">"scripts": {
    "start": "snowpack dev",
    "build": "snowpack build",
    "lint": "eslint *.js src/**/*.js",
    "format": "prettier --ignore-path ./.gitignore --write \"./**/*.{html,json,js,ts,css}\""
},</code></pre>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>start</code>: This will run our development server.
                      You will use this the most.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>build</code>: This will prepare our code to be
                      deployed to production. One person in your group should be
                      designated to run this as needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>lint</code>: This will run Eslint against the code
                      to look for style and syntax errors. You should do this
                      each time you are ready to commit. Make sure to clean up
                      any errors it finds before you commit!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>format</code>: This will run Prettier on your code
                      and format it all consistently. You should also do this as
                      a step in your commit process.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The commands are run in the terminal. If you wanted to start
                    up the development server for example you would type
                    <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. If you wanted to lint your code:
                    <kbd>npm run lint</kbd>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try running the linter now. What did you see? Have the
                    driver open up the <kbd>.eslintrc.json</kbd> file. You may
                    have noticed that one of the errors it is complaining about
                    is that your quotes should all be single. You might be
                    saying to yourself..."why does <em>that</em> matter?" Well,
                    the truth is that it does not really matter whether you use
                    single or double quotes in your code. What matters is that
                    the whole team is consistent in using one or the other.
                    Decide as a team whether you would like to use single or
                    double quotes. Then find the line that looks like this:
                    <code>"quotes":["error", "single"]</code> in the
                    <kbd>.eslintrc.json</kbd> file. If you want single quotes
                    then make no changes. If you want double quotes then change
                    the word "single" to "double".
                  </p>
                  <p class="callout">
                    The <kbd>.eslintrc.json</kbd> file belongs to the team. If
                    your team disagrees with any of the rules that are being
                    enforced, change them! Just make sure that all the team
                    members are on board with the changes. If you do decide to
                    dig into setting up custom Eslint rules you might want to
                    get the <kbd>LintLens</kbd> extension for VSCode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next run <kbd>npm run format</kbd>. Then go and run the
                    linter again. What happened? Have the driver fix any
                    remaining errors , then commit and push the changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each member of the team should run the format AND lint
                    command BEFORE they commit after making any changes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="callout">
                    If you are using VS Code there are extensions you can
                    install that will format (Prettier) and lint (ESLint) your
                    code everytime you save! Alternatively you could take
                    advantage of npm and scripts such as
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts"
                      target="_blank"
                      >prebuild</a
                    >
                    to further automate these tasks
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each person in the group should try running
                  <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. This runs several processes on our
                  code and launches a web server at <code>localhost:8080</code>.
                  It should also open that address in your default browser as
                  well, if it did not you can type that address directly into a
                  browser. You should use this server as you develop your
                  project instead of something like LiveServer!
                  <p>
                    When you are done working you can stop the dev server by
                    typing <kbd>ctrl c</kbd> in the same terminal window in
                    which the process is running. That will terminate it.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should run <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. This will
                  create a directory called <kbd>build</kbd>. Commit those
                  changes and push them to Github. Then go back to the
                  repository at <kbd>github.com</kbd> and go to settings. Scroll
                  down the page until you see the section for Github Pages.
                  Select <kbd>Branch: main</kbd> in the source dropdown. Leave
                  the directory at <kbd>/(root)</kbd>. Notice the URL to your
                  published site at the top of that section. Add a
                  <kbd>build</kbd> to the end of that URL and you should see
                  your built site.
                  <p class="callout">
                    The <kbd>build</kbd> version of the site will be considered
                    the production version. This should always work! The
                    instructor should be able to go to that address at any time
                    and not see any errors. One person in the team should take
                    on the responsibility of running the
                    <kbd>npm run build</kbd> command when the group decides that
                    it is time to incorporate new <em>completed</em> changes.
                    This will usually happen once a week after the pull requests
                    are reviewed and merged (More about pull requests below)

              <ol>
                <li>
                  The driver should create a file in the root of the project
                  called <kbd>team.txt</kbd> and add the link to the team Trello
                  board, and their name. Then commit that change, and push it up

                      This should have resulted in an error with Git. There were
                      multiple changes made to the same file and Git doesn't
                      know which to keep! This results in a
                      <em>merge conflict</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>How can we avoid conflicts? A couple of ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        First make sure whenever you sit down to work on the
                        project you should <em>pull</em> before you do anything
                        else to make sure you get changes any of your teammates
                        have made recently.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Commit often! Small commits are less likely to result in
                        conflicts than large ones...and they are much easier to
                        fix if a conflict does occur.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Take advantage of software design techniques like

                  Before you can commit the merge conflict will need to be
                  resolved. Make sure that the <kbd>team.txt</kbd> file is open.
                  You should see some additions to the file from Git. It should
                  look something like below.
                  <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>

                      />

                  <p>
                    We must decide which code should be kept. The code under the
                    <code><<<<<< HEAD</code> is the code you were just trying to
                    send up. The code under the <code>=========</code> is the
                    code that was already in Github. If you want to keep the
                    code you were just writing, and throw the other away you
                    could choose "Accept Current Change". If you wanted to keep
                    what was on Github and remove your recent changes choose
                    "Accept Incoming Changes". Or if you choose "Accept Both
                    Changes" it will smoosh both sets of changes together. This
                    is often the quickest way to get rid of the conflict, but is
                    usually requires more work to actually fix the problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this case we should accept both, then delete the name
                    without the initial. That would leave us with the most
                    current versions of everything.

                  <p>
                    Once you fix the code you will need to <kbd>commit</kbd> the
                    merge...then you will be able to <kbd>push</kbd> your
                    changes to Github again.

                    This was a simple merge…easy to see what we needed to
                    keep…imagine if the file was 200-300 lines long, and two
                    team members had made edits in 10-15 lines of code scattered
                    across the file and caused a merge conflict! It would have
                    been far harder to figure out what to keep and what to
                    throw…KEEP your commits small!

              <p>Branching</p>
              <p>
                One of the most powerful features of Git is the ability to
                <em>branch</em> your code. Branching makes a copy of your code
                at the current point in time that you can make changes to
                without affecting any other branch! This allows an organization
                to always keep a fully working <em>production</em> version of
                their code that can be deployed at any time, and also work on
                adding features, fixing bugs, etc that often result in things
                breaking until they are done.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also use branches to reduce merge conflicts if multiple
                team members need to make changes to the same file in a
                codebase. Each team member should complete the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create a branch. Name your branch something like
                  <kbd>initials--branch_test</kbd>. (So for me the actual name
                  of the branch would be <kbd>st--branch_test</kbd>)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a file in the root of the project called
                  <kbd>yourname.txt</kbd>. Type your name in the file.
                </li>
                <li>Commit and publish (push) your branch to Github</li>
                <li>
                  Push your commit to Github...then do a pull after the other
                  members of the team have all pushed their branches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switch to one of the new branches in the repository. Notice
                  what happens to the listing of files in your editor when you
                  do. Switch back to your own branch. Switch back to the master
                  branch. Discuss with your team what you saw.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Throughout the semester you will be fixing bugs and adding
                  features to the SleepOutside site. When you assign a task to
                  yourself I would create a new branch to hold the work you will
                  do. Name the branch <kbd>initials--feature-name</kbd>. So if I
                  were going to work on the card dealing with the cart total not
                  calculating correctly, and my name were John Doe, I would make
                  a branch with a name something like
                  <kbd>jd--cart-total-calculation</kbd>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you are done with your work and you are confident
                  everything is working you should submit a pull request (see
                  below). Each week your team will be responsible to setup a
                  meeting with the instructor (project owner) where the pull
                  requests will be reviewed and merged back into the project.
                </p>

              <p>Pull requests</p>
              <p>
                When you are done with the feature that you created a branch
                for, the new code should be merged back into the master or main
                branch. This can be done in two ways...one is by directly
                merging the working branch back into the main branch, and the
                other is through a pull request.
              </p>
              <p>
                On projects where there is only one developer, merging directly
                works fine...but when working with a team it is more common to
                work through pull requests. A pull request essentially means "My
                work is done and tested, I am ready for the code to be merged in
                with the main branch. Can someone check it out and make sure you
                don't see any issues. (So I don't break anything :)"
              </p>
              <p>
                In our case right now, the branches do not contain anything
                important that needs to be merged back into the main branch. So
                most of them can just be deleted. Have one person however submit
                a pull request for their branch so we can see what the process
                is like.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the pull request has been made (you can do this through
                <a
                  href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr"
                  target="_blank"
                  >github.com</a
                >) the driver should go to the repository in github and review
                the request and then finish the merge. Make sure that any extra
                branches are deleted once you are done merging.
