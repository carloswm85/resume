        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will finish the process of converting our site to a
          dynamic site.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team4: Dynamic header and footer" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team4</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team4</code>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                As you completed the reading for this week there were two
                articles about Single Page Applications (SPA). One outlining
                what they are, and another indicating some of the drawbacks to
                them. At this point we need to decide if a Single Page
                Application is the right architecture for our application.
                Discuss with your group your feelings. You may want to pull up
                the two articles (<a

                alternatives.
              </p>
              <!-- <ul>
                <li>
                  I would recommend having a one to one relationship with
                  views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that needs to
                  be shared between modules can be placed in a utility modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The following views are needed: productList, productDetail,
                  cart, checkout
                </li>
                <li>
                  productList and productDetail are going to be mostly dynamic,
                  so let's just generate those entirely through Javascript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  cart and checkout will have more static content on them...so
                  let's load in an html partial as a starting point, and then
                  modify as needed with Javascript.
                </li>
              </ul> -->
              <p>
                Once you are done with your discussion, review the information
                below with the instructor's recommendation and reasoning. Keep
                in mind that there is no one right answer here. There's more
                than one way to skin a cat...as the old adage goes. You may
                disagree with the conclusion or reasoning and that is fine...but
                because the future activities will make certain assumptions
                about the structure of your app I would recommend that you still
                follow the recommendation below.

                <div>
                  <p>SPAs can be great in the right circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Once the page has downloaded switching betwen views is
                      usually very fast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In complex applications where there is a lot of state to
                      manage SPAs make it easier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      when you need a very native application type of a feel.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>But they do come with a few drawbacks:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Initial load times are often higher...people are most
                      sensitive to initial load times...first impressions...
                    </li>
                    <li>SPAs are more complex than multipage apps</li>
                    <li>
                      You lose some great native features of browsers like
                      history
                    </li>
                    <li>SEO often becomes hard</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In the case of our application I'm not sure the additional
                    complexities added by converting to a SPA are worth the
                    extra work and complexity it will introduce:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      We don't have complex state that needs to persist from one
                      page to another. The product listing page for example
                      really doesn't care what happens on the product detail
                      page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It would be really nice to not have to write our own
                      routing and history functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This really isn't trying to duplicate a native app...so a
                      bit of flash on a page load isn't going to feel too out of
                      place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As a retail site initial loading speed needs to be as fast
                      as possible...and SEO is really important to get new
                      customers to the site.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In our case a SPA would be overkill, but there are some
                    advantages to dynamically generating parts of the site. I
                    really like the hybrid approach introduced in the second
                    article. We should implement something along those lines.
                    The good news is that what we have done already kind of
                    follows that model.

              <h3>Navigation</h3>
              <p>
                With a SPA links do not work the way they normally should.
                Normally when you click on a link it makes a request to the host
                server for a new file. We instead need to hijack that request
                and run some Javascript locally.

                Write a function to output the html to display a list of
                products to the home (index.html) page. The function should take
                the list of products as an argument, and insert the HTML markup
                into the DOM. It should leverage the function writted in the
                last step as well.

                Write a function in <kbd>main.js</kbd> that will filter our list
                of products to just the 4 we currently need. Use that function
                to show only those 4 tents.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week02/solution.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
