        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity: Calculator</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will pull several of the topics we have recently
          discussed together. Objects, modules, organization, along with events
          and DOM manipulation with Javascript. The activity will be to build a
          calculator.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Think through the steps that need to take place for a calculator
                to function. Write them out. Be as specific in your can...but
                write them in plain language. My list started like this for
                example:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>wait for a button to be clicked.</li>
                <li>
                  check which button it was
                  <ol>
                    <li>If it was a number...</li>
                    <li>If it was an operation...</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Think about how you would convert your list of steps into code.
                How could you use modules, objects, or classes to better
                organize this code? What modules would you need? What objects
                would make sense? Discuss this with your group.
              </p>

                Create a folder for this project on your computer. Download this
                <a href="../solutions/week05/calc.html" target="_blank"
                  >starter html</a
                >
                and
                <a href="../solutions/week05/calc.css" target="_blank">css</a>.
                Create a javascript file called <kbd>app5.js</kbd>, and add a
                script element to your HTML. We will be using modules, so don't
                forget to add <code>type="module"</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create one more JS file called <kbd>calc.js</kbd>. Implement
                your calculator based off of your work in step one as a module
                in this file.
              </p>

                Style it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add the CSS required to make your list of hikes match this
                <a
                  href="https://wireframe.cc/EuNuwg"
                  target="_blank"

                >.

          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>

              <p>
                Get the details
              </p>

              <p>
                When we touch a hike it would be good if it showed us the full
                details for that hike. Make it so. Replace the list of hikes
                with a detailed view of one hike.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Getting Back to our list</p>
              <p>
                Add a "back" button/link that will take you from the hike
                details back to the main list.
              </p>
            </li>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
