        <p>
          One of the requirements for this course is to develop a portfolio of
          the work that you complete for the course. You will turn this in at
          the end of the semester along with a self evaluation. These items will
          be used to determine your grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          This activity is to give you some ideas for managing this portfolio.
        </p>

            <h3>Code Management</h3>

            <p>
              Most of your portfolio for this course will be made up of code. It
              would make sense then, to use a tool specifically designed to help
              manage code to manage your portfolio. Create a repository for your
              work for this class in
              <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                >Github</a
              >

              >, a free hosted code repository with the core ability to track
              changes.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you aren't sure how to get a version control repository
                setup, here is a cheatsheet using Github:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create an account with
                  <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                    >Github</a
                  >
                  if you don't already have one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once logged in find and click on the "New Repository" button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It will ask for a name, description, and whether to include a
                  "README". Fill out the name, description, and check the Readme
                  box.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should now see a screen listing out the files in the
                  repository (it's a very short list) There should also be a big
                  green button labeled "Clone or download" Click on it and copy
                  the URL in the box. (should look something like
                  <code>https://github.com/matkat99/port.git</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                  At this point you need to decide if you want to manage your
                  repository with the command line or with a GUI tool.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GUI Tool
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          Download and install the
                          <a
                            href="https://desktop.github.com"
                            target="_blank"

                            >Github Desktop</a
                          >
                          app. Launch it and sign in with your Github
                          credentials.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Click on "add a new project" (usually the +) and
                          select "Clone" If you have authenticated to your
                          Github account correctly then you should see your
                          repository listed. Select it and click "Clone
                          Repository". It will ask you where it should store it.
                          Select a directory on your harddrive.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Command line
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Make sure your computer has git installed. Open your
                            command line prompt (Terminal.app on the Mac, CMD on
                            Windows), then type
                          </p>
                          <pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
                          <p>
                            If you get an error go
                            <a
                              href="https://git-scm.com/download"
                              target="_blank"
                              rel="noreferrer"
                              >install git</a
                            >.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Navigate to the folder where you want the project
                            stored on your harddrive. If you are unsure how to
                            do that then lets just put it on your desktop. You
                            will automatically start in your User directory when
                            you open a new command prompt...and it's easy to get
                            back there. Type:
                          </p>
                          <pre><code>cd ~</code></pre>
                          <p>on the Mac or for Windows type:</p>
                          <pre><code>cd %user_profile%</code></pre>
                          <p>then simply type:</p>
                          <pre><code>cd Desktop</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Enter
                            <code
                              >git clone &lt;URL copied from github&gt; &lt;name
                              of directory you want created&gt;</code
                            >
                            Mine for example would look like this:
                          </p>
                          <code
                            >git clone https://github.com/matkat99/port.git
                            portfolio</code
                          >
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now you can open that folder up in your editor and begin
                  making edits. You should probably also run through something
                  like
                  <a
                    href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer"
                    >try.github.io</a
                  >
                  to start learning how to use git.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Index page</h3>
            <p>
              At the root of your repository you should create an
              <kdb>index.html</kdb> file. In this file you should keep a
              directory of all your notes, exercises, challenges, etc that you
              add to the portfolio.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Turn on Github pages</h3>
            <p>
              Log into Github and enter the repository for this class. Goto
              Settings and on the Options page scroll down until you find the
              section on Github Pages. In the dropdown under Source, choose
              <kbd>master branch</kbd>. You should now be able to browse to your
              repository at the URL Github shows you after the page refreshes.
              It will look like this:
              <kbd>https://username.github.io/repositoryname/</kbd>
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Dynamic Table of Contents</h3>

            <p>
              Each week you will be adding to the table of contents of your
              portfolio. Let's create that list of links dynamically with some
              Javascript as a review of what you learned in WDD 230 (CIT 230/CS
              213). Create a directory called <kbd>js</kbd> in your portfolio,
              and add a file called <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Add the appropriate
              <code>script</code> tag to your html and write a JS function that
              will do the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select an <code>ol</code> element from your index.html page
                (This means you need to add the html for this element to your
                page. You can't select something that doesn't exist.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Read a list of links from an array. (You will also need to
                create this array)
              </li>
              <li>
                For each of the items in the array of links you should create a
                <code>li</code> element, add an <code>a</code> element with the
                label and url from the list of links, and add the new
                <code>li</code> element into the <code>ol</code> element you
                grabbed above.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              You can keep the structure of your list of links simple, you will
              need a label that will be shown to the user, and the URL of the
              page that should open when the link is clicked. It might look
              something like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">const links = [
  {
    label: "Week1 notes",
    url: "week1/index.html"
  }
]
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Each week you will simply add new item(s) into your array to have
              them automatically show up in the table of contents.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Record your work</h3>

            <p>
              As you read, take notes and complete exercises record your work in
              this portfolio, making sure to keep the index up to date. If you
              do then turning in the link to your portfolio will be the best way
              to turn in your work each week, and at the mid and final
              checkpoints.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Let's look at an example of how this might look in practice. Visit
          this
          <a
            href=" https://matkat99.github.io/wdd330-portfolio-example/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >WDD 330 repository</a
          >
          on Github. Notice that I created an index file to list out all of my
          work. I included questions from each week, and an indication of how I
          spent my time that week
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/wdd330-portfolio-example"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >github source code</a
          >
          you will see that there are also folders to hold my work from each
          week.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you drill into those folders you will see additional directories
          for organization. Drill into <code>"objects"</code>. You will see an
          <code>index.html</code> file and a couple of javascript files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at the <code>index.html</code> you will see that is is
          basically the template file from the first Doing Stuff chapter, with a
          couple of extra <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements added to the
          bottom to include our javascript. The index is really just to make it
          easier to view our examples in the browser console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a moment to look through the <code>superObjects.js</code> file.
          Notice that I have many of the code examples from the chapter in
          there...I used a lot of <code>console.log()</code> commands to run
          many of the examples. I also used this as an opportunity to record my
          notes from the reading and my thoughts about the examples as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          My workflow would be to open the <code>index.html</code> file in my
          browser, then open up the browser console, then open the chapter I am
          currently working on. If you were to pull these files down and do that
          you would see bunch of output. You could also try additional commands
          right there as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that you will not see <strong>all</strong> of the examples from
          the chapter in the .js files!...many of the examples were exploratory
          in nature so I simply ran them in the console of the browser once I
          had my <code>index.html</code> page open there. It is much faster to
          try lots of variations of a command there than it is to code it all up
          in a JS file. Your goal is to get enough of the example code into the
          file that you can experiment in the browser console and record your
          findings as comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you follow a similar system while working the examples
          yourself...you will find your portfolio ready to show at any time.
          When it is time to start the first Challenge phase, create another
          directory in your repository for your projects and they will be added
          as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Tools such as Github are powerful, but do require a bit of work to
          learn. I haven't mentioned anything about using them in this outline.
          There are many good free resources to get started with them if you
          don't have any previous experience. A search will bring many of them
          up easily. If you use Github, it has a very good getting started
          tutorial right on their site to get you going.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be very worth your time to gain some mastery of at least one
          of these tools.
