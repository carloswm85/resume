        <h1>Calculator 2: Objects</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          In a previous exercise we made a simple adding machine. This activity
          will have you expand that into a complete calculator as well as
          introduce some Javascript troubleshooting techniques and some object
          usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by getting the code. You will need 3 files from this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/calc"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >github folder</a
          >: <kbd>calc2.html</kbd>, <kbd>calc2.js</kbd>, and
          <kbd>calc.css</kbd>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively you could just clone the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261.git"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >whole repository</a
          >. If you do this make sure to change to the
          <kbd>gh-pages</kbd> branch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of your portfolio for this course will be made up of code. It
          would make sense then, to use a tool specifically designed to help
          manage code to manage your portfolio. I would recommend something like
          <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Github</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Bitbucket</a
          >. Both of these are free hosted code repositories with the core
          ability to track changes.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            If you aren't sure how to get a version control repository setup,
            here is a cheatsheet using Github:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Create an account with
              <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                >Github</a
              >
              if you don't already have one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once logged in find and click on the "New Repository" button.
            </li>
            <li>
              It will ask for a name, description, and whether to include a
              "README". Fill out the name, description, and check the Readme
              box.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should now see a screen listing out the files in the
              repository (it's a very short list) There should also be a big
              green button labeled "Clone or download" Click on it and copy the
              URL in the box. (should look something like
              <code>https://github.com/matkat99/port.git</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              At this point you need to decide if you want to manage your
              repository with the command line or with a GUI tool.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  GUI Tool
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Download and install the
                      <a
                        href="https://desktop.github.com"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer"
                        >Github Desktop</a
                      >
                      app. Launch it and sign in with your Github credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Click on "add a new project" (usually the +) and select
                      "Clone" If you have authenticated to your Github account
                      correctly then you should see your repository listed.
                      Select it and click "Clone Repository". It will ask you
                      where it should store it. Select a directory on your
                      harddrive.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Command line
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Make sure your computer has git installed. Open your
                        command line prompt (Terminal.app on the Mac, CMD on
                        Windows), then type
                      </p>
                      <pre><code class="bash">git --version</code></pre>
                      <p>
                        If you get an error go
                        <a
                          href="https://git-scm.com/download"
                          target="_blank"
                          rel="noreferrer"
                          >install git</a
                        >.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Navigate to the folder where you want the project stored
                        on your harddrive. If you are unsure how to do that then
                        lets just put it on your desktop. You will automatically
                        start in your User directory when you open a new command
                        prompt...and it's easy to get back there. Type:
                      </p>
                      <pre><code class="bash">cd ~</code></pre>
                      <p>on the Mac or for Windows type:</p>
                      <pre><code class="bash">cd %user_profile%</code></pre>
                      <p>then simply type:</p>
                      <pre><code class="bash">cd Desktop</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Enter
                        <code
                          >git clone &lt;URL copied from github&gt; &lt;name of
                          directory you want created&gt;</code
                        >
                        Mine for example would look like this:
                      </p>
                      <pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/matkat99/port.git portfolio</code></pre>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Now you can open that folder up in your editor and begin making
              edits. You should probably also run through something like
              <a
                href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                >try.github.io</a
              >
              to start learning how to use git.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Let's look at an example of how this might look in practice. Visit
          this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >CIT261 repository</a
          >
          on Github. Notice that I created a couple of folders to hold my work.
          "ds" is for the examples from the "Doing Stuff" book, and "ntn" is for
          the "Javascript: Novice to Ninja" book.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you drill into those folders you will see additional directories
          for organization. Drill into <code>"ntn/ch5-objects"</code>. You will
          see an <code>index.html</code> file and a couple of javascript files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at the <code>index.html</code> you will see that is is
          basically the template file from the first Doing Stuff chapter, with a
          couple of extra <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements added to the
          bottom to include our javascript. The index is really just to make it
          easier to view our examples in the browser console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a moment to look through the <code>superObjects.js</code> file.
          Notice that I have many of the code examples from the chapter in
          there...I used a lot of <code>console.log()</code> commands to run
          many of the examples. I also used this as an opportunity to record my
          notes from the reading and my thoughts about the examples as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          My workflow would be to open the <code>index.html</code> file in my
          browser, then open up the browser console, then open the chapter I am
          currently working on. If you were to pull these files down and do that
          you would see bunch of output. You could also try additional commands
          right there as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that you will not see <strong>all</strong> of the examples from
          the chapter in the .js files!...many of the examples were exploratory
          in nature so I simply ran them in the console of the browser once I
          had my <code>index.html</code> page open there. It is much faster to
          try lots of variations of a command there than it is to code it all up
          in a JS file. Your goal is to get enough of the example code into the
          file that you can experiment in the browser console and record your
          findings as comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you follow a similar system while working the examples
          yourself...you will find your portfolio ready to show at any time.
          When it is time to start the first Challenge phase, create another
          directory in your repository for your projects and they will be added
          as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Tools such as Github and Bitbucket are powerful, but do require a bit
          of work to learn. I haven't mentioned anything about using them in
          this outline. There are many good free resources to get started with
          them if you don't have any previous experience. A search will bring
          many of them up easily. If you use Github, it has a very good getting
          started tutorial right on their site to get you going.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be very worth your time to gain some mastery of at least one
          of these tools.
