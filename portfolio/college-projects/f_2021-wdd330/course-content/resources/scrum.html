        <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In software development, weekly update meetings (sometimes called
          "standup" or "scrum" meetings) are a common occurrence. These meetings
          are brief, complete accountability reports of each team member's
          weekly progress. Awareness to problems can be raised...but this is not
          the place to solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standup will generally involve each person taking about a minute to
          answer 3 questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
          <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
          <li>What are my blockers?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Blockers are anything that are keeping you from being successful in
          your goals. They are often things outside of your control, but can
          also include troublesome bugs, broken code, design questions that you
          just can't come up with a solution for, they can even be other people.
          "I just didn't get around to it..." is not a blocker...it is however a
          good way to get removed from projects and ultimately fired ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week you will be required to complete a report addressing the
          three questions above.  Please complete this thoughtfully, and be
          specific.  For the second question for example (What am I going to do
          this week?), don't just say "Continue working on my project". Instead
          explain what you hope to get done on your project...ie "I will
          implement the add, subtract, and multiply functionality, including
          adding buttons to control when the functions are called".
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally one could go and look at the code repository for your project
          and see commits that match up with what you report at the end of the
          week!
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't skip over the blockers question! This will be your best path to
          let the instructor know how they can best help you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prepare your responses to the three questions above and post them in
          the comments for this assignment.
