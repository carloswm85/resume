        <h1>Managing the modern Front-end workflow</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Development workflow has become quite complicated for Web development.
          Lets take a medium sized project for example. It could have dozens of
          javascript files, several css files, 3rd party libraries, and who
          knows how many icons, fonts, images, etc are involved. It might be
          using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or it could be transpiling the
          Javascript to make sure that new features will work in older browsers.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            A potential list of tasks that could need to happen everytime
            something changes is this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lint CSS and Javascript to find any coding issues.</li>
            <li>
              Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last
              changes
            </li>
            <li>compile all SCSS/LESS to CSS</li>
            <li>concatinate all CSS into one file for faster loading,</li>
            <li>Minify the CSS to reduce file size.</li>
            <li>
              Transpile Javascript with Babel for wider support for older
              browsers
            </li>
            <li>Concatinate all JS files into one file for faster loading</li>
            <li>Minify and Uglify Javascript to reduce size</li>
            <li>Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS</li>
            <li>
              Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to
              separate them from the development stuff
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Whew! That's a big list...and they have to happen A LOT!
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It's no wonder that developers have produced tools to help manage all
          of this. This activity will introduce a simple implementation of some
          of these tools. The tools fall into three catagories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Package managers: These keep track of all of the external
            dependencies for our app. Both development tools and libraries we
            might be using. It knows not only which packages to download...but
            tracks versions as well. We are using <code>npm</code> for our
            package manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bundlers: bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating,
            minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using
            <code>Parcel</code> as our bundler. Another common bundler is
            Webpack
          </li>
          <li>
            Task managers: these keep track of what needs to be done and when.
            There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each
            phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just
            using <code>npm</code> again for task manager. Other common managers
            are Grunt or Gulp
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It will really help if you are familiar with the command line for
            your Operating system. Here is a quick overview to the
            <a
              href="http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/cmd-line-mac.html"
              target="_blank"

              >command line for Mac</a
            >
            and the
            <a
              href="http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/cmd-line-pc.html"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer"
              >command line for Windows</a
            >
            if you need a primer.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must have
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
              >NodeJS</a
            >
            installed on your computer. Most of these tools require it. Goto
            <a

              target="_blank"

            walkthrough and skip to the Node part for instructions for your OS.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="parcel.zip">boilerplate code</a>. Download this and
            extract it somewhere you can find it on your computer. If you are
            not confident with the command line for your operating system then I
            recommend placing it on your Desktop or in Documents.
          </li>
          <!-- <li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a>: This is a package manager for Node. You can install it
                    by running <code>npm install yarn -g</code> in your command line once you have installed NodeJS</li> -->
        </ul>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            After completing the setup above open the command line on your
            computer and navigate to the directory where you saved the
            boilerplate code.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are a bunch of additional assets that need to be installed.
            Type <code>npm install</code> to get those. Once that is finished
            you will notice a new directory called node_modules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the folder with the boilerplate code in your editor. You will
            notice a few things.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <kbd>node_modules</kbd> : This is where all of the 3rd party
                tools we will need got installed to when you ran 'npm install'
                above.
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>src</kbd>: This is where I have placed all of the code.
                This is where you will work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>package.json</kbd>: This file contains the information
                about the dependencies for the project. When you ran the install
                command this is how it knew what to go get. We can also define a
                few scripts in here.
              </li>
              <li>Various other configuration files.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file in your editor. Look first at
            the <kbd>scripts</kbd> portion. You should see the following
            possible commands:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>prestart</code>: This gets run automatically when you run
                <code>start</code> or you can run it by itself as well. It does
                a bit of cleanup for us.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>start</code>: This command starts up our bundler Parcel.
                This starts a webserver on port 1234, clears out the 'build'
                directory, builds the new files based on what is in 'src'
                (transpiles with babel, compiles our Sass if we are using it,
                and concatenates all of our CSS and JS into separate files.),
                watches our files for changes, re-compiles everything on a
                change and refreshes the browser. It places the code in a
                <kbd>build</kbd> directory. Quite a lot for one simple command!
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>prebuild</code>: just like prestart this runs
                automatically when we run the <code>build</code> process.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>build</code>: This command gets our code ready for
                distribution. It runs a similar process to the
                <code>start</code> above, but also minifies the CSS and JS. It
                creates a <kbd>dist</kbd> directory. If you were publishing your
                app to a server that is the code you would move.
              </li>
              <li><code>watch</code> is very similar to <code>start</code></li>
              <li>
                <code>lint</code> runs a linter on your Javascript and will make
                recommendations and sometimes even changes to your code based on
                the rules it is configured with.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can run any of those scripts by navigating to the project
            directory and typing <kbd>npm run <em>command</em></kbd
            >. So to start parcel running and launch it's built in web server
            you would type <kbd>npm run start</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Look next at the <kbd>devDependencies</kbd> section. This lists out
            all of the tools we are using to facilitate our development. These
            tools will not be a part of the distribution code. This is a good
            thing, I don't know if you noticed...but the
            <kbd>node_modules</kbd> directory is over 100MB!
          </li>
          <li>
            To start up your tools go ahead and run
            <kbd>npm run start</kbd> in the command line. You should see the
            <kbd>build</kbd> directory get created and populated with files. And
            if you point your web browser to
            <code>http://localhost:1234</code> you will see a simple page. Make
            a change to any of the files in the project and the browser will
            auto-refresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you are done working you can hit <code>ctrl-c</code> in your
            command line to end that process.
          </li>
        </ol>
