        <h1>Managing the modern Front-end workflow</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Development workflow has become quite complicated for Web development.
          Lets take a medium sized project for example. It could have dozens of
          javascript files, several css files, 3rd party libraries, and who
          knows how many icons, fonts, images, etc are involved. It might be
          using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or it could be transpiling the
          Javascript to make sure that new features will work in older browsers.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            A potential list of tasks that could need to happen everytime
            something changes is this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lint CSS and Javascript to find any coding issues.</li>
            <li>
              Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last
              changes
            </li>
            <li>compile all SCSS/LESS to CSS</li>
            <li>concatinate all CSS into one file for faster loading,</li>
            <li>Minify the CSS to reduce file size.</li>
            <li>
              Transpile Javascript with Babel for wider support for older
              browsers
            </li>
            <li>Concatinate all JS files into one file for faster loading</li>
            <li>Minify and Uglify Javascript to reduce size</li>
            <li>Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS</li>
            <li>
              Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to
              separate them from the development stuff
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whew! That's a big list...and they have to happen A LOT!</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It's no wonder that developers have produced tools to help manage all
          of this. This activity will introduce a simple implementation of some
          of these tools. The tools fall into three catagories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Package managers: These keep track of all of the external
            dependencies for our app. Both development tools and libraries we
            might be using. It knows not only which packages to download...but
            tracks versions as well. We are using <code>npm</code> for our
            package manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bundlers: bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating,
            minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using
            <code>Parcel</code> as our bundler. Another common bundler is
            Webpack
          </li>
          <li>
            Task managers: these keep track of what needs to be done and when.
            There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each
            phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just
            using <code>npm</code> again for task manager. Other common managers
            are Grunt or Gulp
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will be using a NPM/Node based workflow for this course this
          semester. It is important that you understand how these tools work
          together. The Week1 team activity will walk your group through setting
          this workflow up.
