        <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In software development, weekly update meetings (sometimes called
          "standup" or "scrum" meetings) are a common occurrence. These meetings
          are brief, complete accountability reports of each team member's
          weekly progress. Awareness to problems can be raised...but this is not
          the place to solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standup will generally involve each person taking about a minute to
          answer 3 questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
          <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
          <li>What are my blockers?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Blockers are anything that are keeping you from being successful in
          your goals. They are often things outside of your control, but can
          also include troublesome bugs, broken code, design questions that you
          just can't come up with a solution for, they can even be other people.
          "I just didn't get around to it..." is not a blocker...it is however a
          good way to get removed from projects and ultimately fired ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week you will be required to complete a report addressing the
          three questions above. Â This will be completed by scheduling a short
          meeting each week with your team and the instructor. Discuss
          availability with your group then sign up for a time with the
          instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can sign up for a slot in
          <a href="https://calendly.com/thompsonda/15min" target="_blank"
            >Calendly</a
          >, or you can arrange directly with the instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally one could go and look at the code repository for your
          portfolio and see commits that match up with what you report at the
          end of the week!
