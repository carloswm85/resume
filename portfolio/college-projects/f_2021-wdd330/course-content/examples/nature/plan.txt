iNaturalist API  https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/#!/Observations/get_observations
Create an app that will get current location from GPS, then show an x mile wide map section.
Dropdown that will allow to pick an animal that lives in the area…pick an animal and it will draw recent observations on the map. 
Phase 1
Create basic interface from wireframe  https://wireframe.cc/jud9pJ
Use placeholder image for map   
Become familiar with API…pull some data out: native species list, observations …add to project as objects.
Generate dropdown list from species list...can't filter species on location...autocomplete instead?
PLaces: 
Yellowstone: 10211
species: 
vertibrate sub-phylum: 355675
bobcat: 41976
wolf: 42048
Filter observations by selected species
Phase 2
Learn about gps, expanding a lat/long point into an area. http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates
Learn more about GeoLocation services.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API
calculate tiles http://oms.wff.ch/calc.htm
bounding box tool https://boundingbox.klokantech.com
Get current location from browser.
Filter observations data based off of a selected species and location if allowed, and display it on the screen.  Graph by date?
Phase 3
Refactor code to use modules
Switch to pulling data from the API
Phase 4
Display a map with plotted observations
