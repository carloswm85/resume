          (Sitepoint) book. Remember though that if you are having trouble
          understanding a concept the way that this book presents it...go find
          another source!
        </p>
        <p>Keep the following Tips from week 1 in mind as well.</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read for understanding not completion. This means that some weeks
              when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through
              the reading. Other weeks you might have to read several
              times...and spend lots of time working through the code examples
              until you understand. You may even need to go find a few extra
              sources on your own for some topics.
            </li>

            <li>
              Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing
              these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with
              the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work
              through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take notes! One of the most important things that you can include
              in your notes are questions that arose in your mind as you were
              reading. Having this list will help you to know what topics need
              more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor
              asks: "Any questions from the reading?"
            </li>
            <li>
              If I didn't assign a chapter in the book it is not because those
              topics are not important...but often because I expect you to
              already understand those concepts from a previous course. You may
              want to read some of the chapters I don't assign if the topics
              look unfamiliar to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is not a specific list of exercises given because
                <strong>not everyone needs the same thing</strong>. This course
                is designed to give you the flexibility to spend your time in
                the areas you need, instead of a one size fits all approach
                where you spend all your time for the week on concepts that you
                may have already mastered. This approach will frustrate some of
                you, but becomes very powerful once you adjust to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example you might read through the chapter on Functions and
                maybe the author's explanation left some questions in your mind
                about arguments. So you do a quick search which turns up
                <a
                  href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/how-to-use-arguments-and-parameters-in-ecmascript-6/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >this article</a
                >
                that provides some great clarification. Then you visit the list
                of exercises below and find
                <a
                  href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php"
                  target="_blank"
                  >this list</a
                >
                of problems that will give you as much practice as you need
                writing functions that use arguments and parameters.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Again, don't be afraid to find your own sources, sometimes the
                way an author explains a concept will not compute with your
                brain. Find another explanation! As a starting point, here are
                some additional resources you have free access to:
